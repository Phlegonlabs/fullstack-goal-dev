# EPIC-document-review-handoff: List the complete package in chat

Status: complete

## Problem And Baseline

The owner requested that complete Product Definition and UI flows list all
documents in chat for one review. Existing approval responses link core sources
and HiFi pages, but do not explicitly reconcile all current package documents
or combine Product Definition and UI at the final UI handoff.

First observation on 2026-10-04: repository
`C:/Users/mps19/.codex/worktrees/831e/product-delivery-harness`, detached HEAD
`1782fa000b107396fd36787c7df7fad8a2141c82`, clean working tree. No prior baseline
exists for this outcome. The owner named `codex/document-review-handoff`; it was
created from observed local remote-tracking `origin/development` at
`ec9c599c70dce3a46b948865fc300503a4c71998`. Its tree matches the first observation.
The remote-tracking ref was not refreshed. This is direct source maintenance;
there is no consumer PRD, design package or PLAN/RUN. UI impact: none.

## Accepted Scope And Checks

One parent writer updates both canonical skills, one shared presentation
reference and all four README descriptions. Approval and final handoff responses
must list individual verified links, purpose and status for all current sources
and evidence. Final UI handoff combines both packages for whole-package review.
Existing approval, path, publication and implementation boundaries remain.

Verify the two existing skill-contract suites, skill specification, document
weight and diff checks. Inspect missing-file and later-stage handling, staging
versus publication paths, Chinese/English copies, manifest siblings and the
combined handoff. No product UI, runtime schema, release, installation or push
is part of this outcome. No new artifact class requires an ignore pattern.

## Document Impact

Both `SKILL.md` files route existing approval/handoff checkpoints to
`skills/product-definition-builder/references/review-presentation.md`.
All four README descriptions document the same behavior. This Epic is indexed
in `docs/DOCUMENTS.md`; historical release and Epic results remain intact.

## Change Log

| Change / request | Reason and affected scope | Commit / evidence | Verification and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-04: complete chat review inventory | Owner request; Product Definition and UI approval/handoff rules and four READMEs | Working-tree on `codex/document-review-handoff` at baseline `ec9c599c70dce3a46b948865fc300503a4c71998`; the atomic commit containing this record identifies the result | Product Definition 100 and UI 12 contract tests PASS; skill-spec, docs-weight and diff checks PASS; no independent review or release claimed |

## Results And Remaining Work

Entry document inventory reports only `loaded_identity_unobserved` and
`baseline_review_required`. No loaded digest is inferred from installed bytes.
Observed installed Harness version is 0.60.0; installed AGENTS template SHA-256
is `0d5064d94c0072ad2d1f06f3b516dab328d425be79454df10b50ce6f44b2470e`.
Applicable shared rules are current by meaning. The source repository's
Required Reading, Git Flow and omission of consumer bindings/deployment remain
intentional local choices. No AGENTS update or translation backfill applies.

Focused verification completed on the scoped working-tree candidate. Logs:
`C:/Users/mps19/AppData/Local/Temp/pdh-document-review-1uyvykeh/`.
The parent inspected individual-file coverage, missing-file and later-stage
handling, current versus archived sources, stage-specific path rules and the
combined review. Both skill reference targets resolve. Existing ignore rules
cover test bytecode, environment values and dependencies; source/docs remain
visible. The installed template matches the source template byte-for-byte.
Scoped diff plus new reference SHA-256, excluding record/index edits:
`876f2936b3a7d33dd5c73adbd138a3d0ccb18887361ca88a3b18a2284b33f39f`.

The expanded handoff inventory also flags retired names in all four READMEs.
Inspection places these in unchanged pre-0.24 version history and legacy
installer retirement guidance, not in the new review instructions. Preserve
that history; document-sync `review_required` is not an approval or test PASS.

This documentation-only outcome is complete locally. The full release matrix,
independent review, publication and installed-skill update were not requested
or performed. The installed 0.60.0 skills do not yet contain this source change.
