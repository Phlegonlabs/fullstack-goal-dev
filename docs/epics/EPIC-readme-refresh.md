# README Refresh

Status: in_progress
Route: bounded direct documentation maintenance
Product UI impact: none; README presentation changes

## Problem And Baseline

The owner requested README reorganization and image generation for every existing cover on 2026-10-05.
The opening currently places detailed operating rules before the project introduction and installation.

First observation: `product-delivery-harness`, detached HEAD `7bfc6235fc76ee837fc3f710c1c47d88c7ea3d03`, clean index and working tree.
No earlier baseline exists for this outcome.
This source task has no consumer PRD, architecture, PLAN/RUN or design approval package.

## Accepted Scope

Reorganize all four README languages and replace the three existing cover PNGs with generated images.
The Spanish README shares the English cover.
Keep installation commands, skill behavior, version facts, release rules and complete history accurate.
Keep Mermaid diagrams and live CI/version badges as verifiable reference information.

Use one writer per checkout.
The frontend binding is Claude Code Bridge, `claude-opus-5-5`, `high`, under the effective owner instructions.
Independent review uses native `reviewer`, `gpt-6.1-sol`, `xhigh`, with read-only scope.
On 2026-10-06, the owner requested commit, push and merge of this complete change.
Use the proposed `codex/readme-refresh` branch and the required frontend/reviewer routes.
Publish one reviewed PR to `main`; preserve separate task commits and verify the resulting main tree.
The repository's required version update is `0.62.2`.
Branch deletion, worktree removal and unrelated changes remain outside this task.

## Acceptance And Dependencies

| Outcome | Verification | Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Readers find purpose, installation and the appropriate skill before detailed rules | Four-language content parity and matching wide/narrow previews | Authorized frontend writer |
| All three existing covers use one refreshed visual system | Built-in generation, glyph inspection, file decoding and asset references | Generated images |
| Existing contracts and history remain intact | Local links, preserved history, focused skill contracts and independent review | Fixed candidate |
| Local work remains traceable | Scoped diff, atomic commits and final document audit | Exact work branch |

## Document Impact

The write scope covers four root READMEs, three `assets/readme-cover-*.png` files, this Epic and `docs/DOCUMENTS.md`.
The main publication requires version metadata and the RUNBOOK default to advance to `0.62.2`.
Skill behavior, installers and historical records remain unchanged.
PNG source assets stay tracked.
Logs, previews, prompts and temporary dependencies stay outside the checkout; no new ignore pattern is needed.

## Change Log

| Observation / change | Evidence | Verification / remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-05 entry | Detached baseline above; local history starts with the 0.62.1 repair release | First observation only. Installed Harness is `0.62.1`; loaded identity is unobserved. Document inventory requests semantic review and flags legacy names in retained history. No snapshot saved. |
| 2026-10-05 generated covers | Built-in image generation; editorial blueprint composition with ivory, black, cobalt, lavender and mint | English, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese title/subtitle inspection passed. Prompts and original outputs remain checkout-external. Copy and reference verification follow. |
| 2026-10-05 before preview | `C:/Users/mps19/.codex/visualizations/2026/10/06/01a10fde-1ee1-7283-9ab3-b8cd44745537/preview-before.json` | Twelve local Chromium captures cover four languages, 1200px light/dark and 390px light. This is local Markdown fallback evidence, not GitHub verification. Badge pixels loaded despite the preview's requested blocking route; they do not establish CI status. All captured task processes exited. |
| 2026-10-05 asset checkpoint | Working-tree covers copied to their three existing paths. PNG SHA-256: English `d1f2f794c83e4b396870cf4fb362298414466c898f59f41fd435dcfa4959abe8`; Traditional Chinese `72ab665ed5869c589de429ae73810db7f816cff757819cf0e9b0014a6e6d37ad`; Simplified Chinese `3c49f1c2a841344c71b1f8db5a535f871e7858ca811c030f0d6ab787d1119090` | All decode at 1774×887. Existing references resolve. Twelve matching captures are in `preview-covers.json`; recorded task processes exited. Whitespace and tracked-asset checks passed. Atomic commit awaits exact branch confirmation. |
| 2026-10-05 interim handoff | HEAD unchanged at the detached baseline; three modified PNGs, modified index document and one new Epic; no staged files | Installed and source template `0.62.1` share SHA-256 `feed8dcc70b3691d9822a1b05641d4502dae452fd1926954f09db3fc78fff62f`. Shared rules are current by meaning. The source repository retains its documented Git Flow, Required Reading and stage-slot/deployment exceptions. README text remains unchanged. Local `main` is stale at `bdae1d82`; current HEAD carries local tag `v0.62.1`. No fetch or publication ran. |
| 2026-10-06 publication request and branch | Owner: `ccommit and push and merge all`; remote `main` read through GitHub is exactly the entry baseline | Created `codex/readme-refresh` from that released baseline. Only the recorded covers/Epic/index are dirty. Image decoding, existing references and whitespace checks passed before the first atomic commit. |
| 2026-10-06 cover commit | `33956400f59928540df3996ea2a05795aa8f5d6f`, `docs(readme): refresh multilingual cover illustrations` | Three PNGs and their required record committed. GitHub before captures are checkout-external: `github-before-wide.png` and `github-before-narrow.png`. |
| 2026-10-06 README authoring and correction | Working-tree four-language purpose, installation and navigation move ahead of operating detail; 16 disclosures per locale | Claude Opus 5.5 author timed out during self-check. Its process exited. Read-only closeout found an installation-order defect; bounded author repair passed in session `d936a89d-5ad7-402c-b26c-7463615c5ef4`. Launcher requested `high`; provider effort is unobserved. No fallback used. |
| 2026-10-06 content checkpoint | `work/readme-content-r4.json` under the external evidence root below binds all four raw file hashes | All 103 old version entries, original headings and 21 code fences per locale retained. Spanish's stale Pi-only prompt now matches the generic-host contract. Installer prerequisite prose is split around the unchanged commands; Spanish alt text is localized. No new missing local link. Whitespace and 60 skill-contract tests passed against these working-tree bytes. Independent review and renderer verification remain pending. |

## Results And Remaining Work

Generated covers now occupy the current README asset paths.
Four-language authoring and focused source checks are complete.
Version metadata, full candidate verification, independent review and approved publication remain pending.
Evidence root: `C:/Users/mps19/.codex/visualizations/2026/10/06/01a10fde-1ee1-7283-9ab3-b8cd44745537/`.
