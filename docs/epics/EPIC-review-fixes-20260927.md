# EPIC-review-fixes-20260927: Fix the verified findings from the seven-skill review

Status: in_progress

## Problem And Baseline

A multi-agent review of the seven bundled skills reported 62 findings. Verification refuted three
(dh-docs-06, dh-docs-07, small-skills-activation-profile-matrix-nominal), so 59 survived. They cover
authorization targets, push isolation, RUN closeout state, gate checks, approval digests, UI and
design-system gates, SEO and security review contracts, installers, CI and documentation drift.

- Repository: `product-delivery-harness`, source-maintenance work. No consumer PRD applies.
- Baseline: `70ab12bd8770ec4d9ae394b66e640c8c597c7cbb` on `codex/runtime-contract-adoption`.
- Branch: `codex/review-fixes`, observed at `fae73077` when this record was written.
- Review inputs: first review (62 findings) and a second review of `70ab12bd..f14f4d5b`
  (harness-correctness, security, skills-correctness and docs-consistency findings).

## Accepted Scope

Fix each surviving finding with the smallest correct change and a focused test, or document it
when code cannot or should not change. Writers worked in separate worktrees with explicit file
ownership; the parent integrated them serially. Out of scope: rewriting the legacy push parser,
force or lease pushes, new release infrastructure. This record grants no actions.

## Acceptance And Dependencies

| Requirement / TEST ID | Expected outcome | Verification / environment | Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Each fixed finding | Failure scenario from the review no longer reproduces | Focused test per finding, run by its writer | Writer worktree at the listed commit |
| Changed safety checks | A negative test proves the unsafe input is still rejected | Focused tests in the owning skill | none |
| Release surfaces | `VERSION`, `package.json`, RUNBOOK default, README badges and history agree on 0.55.0 (0.55.1 after round 4) | `test_skill_contract.py` | none |
| Full regression | Required Verification in `AGENTS.md` passes on the integrated head | Full suite, run by the parent | Round-3 fixes integrated |

## Document Impact

| Changed source / requirement | Affected live artifact | Required recheck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approval digests (pdb-1), Styling approach row (dsc-01) | Consumer Product Definition packages | Re-run finalize; re-record Product Definition Approval and Stack Decision Checkpoint |
| Environment Status RFC3339 Checked (dh-gates-2) | Consumer `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | `check_deployment.py` |
| Cleanup lifecycle exact targets (dh-authz-1) | PLANs of runs that require 0.55.0 | PLAN validation |
| Impeccable required, enhancement UI gate names (udb-04, pdb-2) | Consumer `ui-design.md` and Enhancement Impact Records | UI and product checkers |
| All of the above | Four READMEs, `docs/DOCUMENTS.md`, version 0.55.0 | `test_readme_structure.py`, `test_skill_contract.py` |

| Round-2 follow-ups | security-04 legacy push isolation; cleanup nodes without a target rejected in PLAN and deferred by the selector; docs-consistency promotion order, stale verifier docs, restore rule, new required inputs; skills-correctness-4 mobile stack record; routine maintenance and main default branch wording | `53b525fe`, `bfe15af0`, `0ef94a48`, `5e494867`, `6f2ac607`, `a9eb17c9`, `f2635c76`, `0a18d480`, `705ba403`, `ffdf374d`, `4a60347a`; merges `ec272b25`, `fae73077` | Focused tests passed per writer |
| Round-3 fixes | docs-consistency-macos-renameat2 and skills-correctness-1: RUN, DOCUMENTS and design-system commits keep the atomic exchange and add macOS `renameatx_np` `RENAME_SWAP`; security-03, harness-correctness-03: new receipt and cleanup rules apply only to runs that require 0.55.0; harness-correctness-01 subagent review deferred under a wildcard mission scope; skills-correctness-2 non-checkout repo root; security-01 CI extraheader allowed for local reads; security-02 live-head diff without rename detection; security-05 readback repo discovery; security-06 repo signing programs; harness-correctness-05/security-07 case-insensitive default branch; harness-correctness-02 nested token-block styles; skills-correctness-5 approval date only for current HiFi; acceptance register commit order; skills-correctness-3 documented; trusted-host key ACL in the Windows test; README preflight wording and lockfile 0.55.0 | `30560d51`, `43b8db06`, `96051fc4`, `2f8d037d`, `514f174e`, `4f0461e6`, `644c64df`, `89cb21de`, `84203955`, `e7c95443`, `08c96e35`, `b707e99e`, `31fb85d7`, `da617d3d`, `045e9bae`, `78fca572`, `27ea4979`; merges `7792eb40`, `2eaa412f`, `91437497`, `85c421a4`, `8e05d3e0` | Focused tests passed per writer; full suite below. POSIX exchange paths verified by reading and mocked-libc tests only |
| README sync, version 0.55.0, index, this record | cross-readme-mermaid-provider-section, docs-consistency-readme-sync, docs-consistency-epic-and-version-sync, skills-correctness-6, cross-documents-index-stale-release-status | `99372247`, `9cc2617d`, `5a3cf8be`, and the commit that adds this file | README structure, skill contract and docs-weight tests passed |

Round 4 was observed 2026-09-28 on `codex/review-followups` from base `2fa9b343` (v0.55.0).
Five writers worked in separate worktrees; the parent merged them serially, then added the
leftover fixes and this documentation sync. All entries are committed.

| Change / request | Reason and affected scope | Commit / evidence | Verification and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exchange races | RUN, DOCUMENTS and design-system exchange commits, POSIX and Windows: the restore check compares with the displaced bytes, not the expected ones; displaced bytes move to a named `.recovery` file before any other read (Windows keeps `.backup`/`.rollback`) and the error names that path; a second write moved out by the restore is kept unless it matches our payload | `603a7c16`, `732efe56`, `d7f6e255`, `1be57bcc`, `d9b037b9`; merge `2c84dbb0` | Exchange and concurrent-write tests passed on Windows. The three older native displaced-edit tests passed only because their regex also matched the buggy `restore` message; they now require `displaced bytes changed`. Real POSIX primitives still need Linux/macOS CI |
| Authorization gating | Mission launches and `app_threads` reviewers under a `*` mission scope are deferred by the selector and refused by `lease-worker` at every RUN-v11 version (validation already rejected them); the 0.55.0 `coordination_paths` and protected `delete_branches` checks skip only pins that parse below 0.55.0 | `9ec65427`, `8bcbddd7`, `2883140c`, `c924894c`, `3fd33787`, `206a92ed`; merge `3daeeb9c` | Focused tests passed: `test_select_ready_nodes` 64, `test_harness_v11` 29, `test_lifecycle_cleanup_targets` 9, `test_harness_manifest` 117 and neighbors |
| Acceptance slot and template rows | dh-docs-01 PLAN/RUNBOOK rows (`SRC-004`, `delivery-acceptance` gate, `N-ACCEPTANCE-GATE`, two edges); the register is committed at H2 and recorded with `record-integration`; `check_delivery_acceptance.py` needs `--candidate-sha` or `--candidate-from-head` and requires the candidate to be HEAD or an ancestor with only register, evidence and coordination changes after it | `5ea531b3`, `3dc114f6`, `62a89456`, `4fbac821`, `1f769049`, `3026b62a`, `887ca93a`, `df04a0e4`, `b921e87b`, `4b76728d`; merge `e02743a2` | Focused tests passed: `test_delivery_acceptance` 31, `test_close_wave` 40, `test_new_run` 10 and neighbors. The checker cannot see the RUN version, so the Git check also applies to in-flight 0.55.0 runs |
| Contract adoption check | dh-docs-04: workers and reviewers return `contract_adoption_check`; recording transitions require it under an adopted contract for runs that require 0.55.1; the wrapped reviewer file is accepted, a blocked reviewer's mismatch digest is kept, and the check stays out of security results | `9b3339cf`, `69a88cb5`, `5fcea6d0`, `641df034`, `526ec426`, `ea469dbd`, `b91a7d2a`, `6ccd5a22`; merge `b0596941` | Focused tests passed: `test_validate_worker_result` 38, `test_harness_v11` 30, `test_write_path_transitions` 26 |
| Current-HiFi cutover | skills-correctness-3: a legacy approval decided on or after 2026-09-27, or with a HiFi or motion receipt run from that date, needs current HiFi evidence; publication, the compiler preflight and UI joins enforce it (joins from 0.55.1 after the final review fixes) | `d518d6a1`, `7dcd0307`, `89d0791c`, `a0400101`, `ab9caf5b`, `72538ec2`; merge `a0fd1245` | Focused UI, compiler and Harness tests passed. The compiler preflight has no RUN version gate |
| Leftovers | DA-5: with an acceptance gate in PLAN, worker-result validation refuses a worker change outside every task `write_scope` in all workspace modes; `--contract-adoption-check` documented in the state model, RUNBOOK and security review skill | `8434dccc`, `6c3bb959` | `test_validate_worker_result` 41 OK, rerun during the doc sync |
| Base UI / Radix Primitives | Product Definition names both as headless React component-foundation options, one per product; UI Design Builder draws the chosen layer's states and focus behavior | `6238c318` | Product Definition `test_skill_contract` 96 OK, rerun during the doc sync |
| Final review fixes | Fresh correctness and security review of `2fa9b343..d87df8ed`: security-01/correctness-acceptance-evidence-whitelist acceptance evidence must sit under `evidence/` next to the register; security-02 the worker guard finds the acceptance gate in any argv form and fails closed; security-03 workers can never write the register or its evidence; correctness-review-retryable-needs-adoption-check plus a pre-existing conflict: `retryable_failure` and `contract_gap` reviews may omit the adoption check and validators now accept their findings, so a crashed review can be recorded; correctness-compiler-preflight-cutover-ungated and correctness-hifi-join-gate-0550-inflight: UI and pair joins apply the dated rule from 0.55.1 by RUN pin; security-04 receipts compared with the 2026-09-27T00:00:00Z instant | `d077de32`, `8d9d3ee5`, `115c36a0`, `66bfd012`, `cbc5a73e`, `a1065919`, `36f16b38`, `80ebdfd5`, `bb8d9a11`, `d1f82287`, `832b1155`; merges `152b44a5`, `85383c34`, `909013c9` | Focused tests passed per writer and after integration; full suite below |
| README sync, version 0.55.1, index, this record | 0.55.1 release surfaces and history; README descriptive sections for round 4 and Base UI; these rows and the DOCUMENTS status | `bfc0e782`, `c28c7d6a`, and the commit that adds these rows | README structure, skill contract and docs-weight checks passed |

### Skipped or partial, with reasons

- dh-git-push-6: documented only. A lease or force push flag is forbidden here, so the residual
  window between the remote recheck and the no-force push is described instead.
- dh-authz-4: not changed. The regex parser only serves pinned pre-0.38 RUN recovery.
- udb-05: skipped. `review-workflow.md` makes the preserved-page flag intentional.
- cross-installer-dirty-bytes-no-source-identity: installers still install uncommitted bytes;
  refusing them was replaced by printing and recording the source commit and dirty state.
- dh-docs-01: partial. The PLAN template names the delivery-acceptance entries in prose. The
  template rows were left for a follow-up because `MISSION_RUNBOOK.template.md`,
  `test_new_run.py` and `test_render_tasks_view.py` fixtures must change together. Done in round 4.
- skills-correctness-3: documented limitation. Only `check_ui_publication.py` enforces the udb-01
  HEAD comparison; Harness joins and the compiler preflight still accept legacy approvals.
  Fixed in round 4.

## Results And Remaining Work

### Breaking changes (0.55.0)

- Product Definition Package and Stack Checkpoint digests cover raw bytes, including fences,
  indented lines and HTML comments. Re-run finalize and re-record both approvals.
- Mobile/Desktop stacks need a `Styling approach` row.
- Environment Status Checked values must be RFC3339 with a timezone.
- Cleanup lifecycle nodes need an exact target in runs that require 0.55.0.
- Impeccable critique and audit are required before Visual Approval.
- Enhancement UI rows name Wireframe Validation and Visual Approval.

### Changes consumers may notice (0.55.1)

- `check_delivery_acceptance.py` needs `--candidate-sha` or `--candidate-from-head`. An
  in-flight 0.55.0 run fails the gate if its register commit holds unlisted or product files,
  or if it passes a stale `--candidate-sha` after a repair.
- Under an adopted contract, runs that require 0.55.1 need `contract_adoption_check` from
  every worker and non-blocked reviewer.
- A legacy approval dated on or after 2026-09-27 on `ui-evidence/2` fails the compiler
  preflight at any run version.

### Verification

- Focused tests per writer passed; see the Change Log rows.
- Full suite on `27ea4979` (Windows 11, Python 3.14, 2026-09-27), from the repository root:
  `check_skill_spec.py`, `pyflakes` on all six script dirs, `docs_weight.py` and
  `git diff --check 70ab12bd HEAD` passed. Unit suites: delivery-harness 1318 OK (16 skipped),
  product-definition-builder 240 OK, ui-design-builder 292 OK, design-system-compiler 116 OK
  (4 skipped), product-activation 56 OK, seo-growth-review 21 OK. Golden path 1 OK.
- Not run: the Playwright browser tests (`PDH_REQUIRE_BROWSER_TESTS=1`) and Linux/macOS CI.
- 2026-09-27 first CI run on `a3da039d` (PR #128): windows-hardening passed; validate (Linux)
  failed 1 test, macos failed 353 (209 failures, 144 errors). The Linux failure was the
  tracked-symlink installer test reading pwsh's colored, "|"-wrapped error record; fixed in
  `7db24835`. The macos job is set non-blocking in `221bac00` (owner decision, 2026-09-27).
- PR #128 review (Codex connector) left two P1 threads that blocked the squash merge:
  closeout reachability let a dependency activate an untaken repair route (fixed in `fd9600b1`,
  regression `test_a_dependency_does_not_activate_an_untaken_repair_route`), and both installers
  could overwrite an existing `<backup>.source` receipt (fixed in `b125ba8f`, regressions
  `test_*_keeps_an_existing_source_receipt`; installer tests 21 OK on Windows).
- Round 4 and final review fixes: full suite on `9e370909` (Windows 11, Python 3.14,
  2026-09-28) from the repository root: `check_skill_spec.py`, `pyflakes`, `docs_weight.py` and
  `git diff --check 2fa9b343 HEAD` passed. Unit suites: delivery-harness 1358 OK (16 skipped),
  product-definition-builder 240 OK, ui-design-builder 296 OK, design-system-compiler 118 OK
  (4 skipped), product-activation 56 OK, seo-growth-review 21 OK. Golden path 1 OK. Browser
  tests and Linux/macOS runs are left to CI.

- Release integration (2026-09-28): `codex/review-followups` (#130), `codex/macos-support` (#129) and `codex/remove-wireframe-stage` are combined on `codex/release-0.56.0` as one 0.56.0 release (merges `412db6b4`, `32bb7de1`); 0.55.1 was never tagged. Full suite on `0d105c78` passed (delivery-harness 1368 OK/19 skipped, product-definition-builder 240, ui-design-builder 308, design-system-compiler 119/4 skipped, product-activation 56, seo-growth-review 21, golden path 1, static checks) and CI passed on Linux, Windows and macOS. The final correctness + security review found no blockers and 8 confirmed issues (stale wireframe wording in Harness references, templates and README prompts; PRD operations heading grammar; HiFi copy label fallback; legacy maintenance dispatch message); all were fixed on `fix0560/*` and merged.

### Open follow-ups

- macOS support: Harness fails 353 tests on macos-latest. Causes seen: `_trusted_executable`
  rejects Homebrew Git (symlinked, user-owned under `/opt/homebrew`), `/var` symlink temp roots
  hit the transition-path link check, `linked skill paths are not supported`, and `/dev/fd/3`
  permission errors. Remove `continue-on-error` from the macos job once these pass.
- The POSIX commit paths (Linux and macOS), including the round-4 race recovery arms, are
  verified only by reading, mocked-libc and os-proxy tests until CI runs them.
- Rerunning acceptance after H2 needs a formal PLAN revision; a transition that accepts a
  register-only commit on top of a repair would remove that cost. Manifest validation does not
  require the acceptance gate entries or reject unreplaced `<...>` argv placeholders. A product
  commit that lands between the scenario run and the register commit, and that the register
  names, passes the Git check; only review catches it.
- Optional (CAC-4): the recording transitions could recompute the contract digest at record time.

### 2026-09-28 — follow-up audit of 47 documentation findings

Owner request: use multiple agents to fix the pasted audit findings, commit, push and merge.
This follow-up repairs the same seven-skill contract outcome; earlier evidence above stays historical.

- First observation: repository `product-delivery-harness`, branch `codex/macos-support`,
  clean HEAD `1591a4482155f9601b568b2c357857629dd6c0b1`; remote `main`
  `2fa9b343175f585aca1da551edc0a8654380de9b` is its ancestor. Existing macOS work is
  recorded in `EPIC-macos-support.md` and PR #129. No other worktree is in this fix scope.
- Route: direct source maintenance, parent is the sole writer; three read-only agents
  inspect Harness, design, and Product Definition/activation/security contracts.
  No consumer PRD, PLAN/RUN or product UI is involved. UI impact: none.
- Scope: correct confirmed audit inconsistencies in canonical skills, references,
  templates and agent prompts; update all four READMEs, release version and focused
  regressions. Keep current validator semantics and historical approvals intact.
- Acceptance: account for H1-H15, M1-M14 and L1-L18; verify corrected commands and
  contract wording against code; run the required full suite with browser checks,
  obtain independent review, publish the verified candidate, then follow the separate
  exact-SHA main-promotion gate. The pasted L17 and several other lines are truncated;
  unresolved source text must be reported rather than invented.
- Gitignore: no new repository-local generated artifact class. Test/review logs live
  outside the checkout at `C:/Users/mps19/Documents/Codex/2026-09-28/pdh-audit-fixes/work/`.
- Document sync: installed Harness `0.55.0`; loaded digest unobserved. First-observation
  report requires semantic review, as expected. No consumer PRD/architecture translation
  is applicable. Installed-template drift and final diff evidence are pending.
- Verification and result: in progress; no new test or review PASS claimed yet.

#### Audit repair checkpoint

The parent implemented the source-supported repairs and documented all 47
dispositions in `docs/audits/2026-09-28-contract-audit.md`. Compatibility pointers
remain. The unrecoverable L17 allegation was checked against the adjacent motion
source inventory, which already contains its ten linked sources. Operations remain
required manual review; no automatic parser enforcement is claimed. Version 0.55.1
and all four README descriptions/history entries accompany the fixes.

Focused verification: Harness contract 60, Product Definition contract 96, UI
contract 12, compiler contract 10, and documented-command regressions 2 all passed.
Skill specification, focused pyflakes and whitespace checks passed. The earlier
wording-assertion failures and corrected command fixture are retained in the audit
record and external logs. Full suite and exact-candidate independent review are
required next; this checkpoint does not claim release completion.

The observed installed template remains 0.55.0. Shared rules are current by meaning;
the source's `0.38+` threshold clarification adds no permission or policy change.
Local main-only Git Flow, required-reading replacement, absent consumer bindings
and deployment/activation omissions remain intentional. The final exact-SHA test,
review and publication receipt is maintained at
`C:/Users/mps19/Documents/Codex/2026-09-28/pdh-audit-fixes/work/handoff.json` and
reported in the task handoff. Next owner/action: parent verifies and publishes the
candidate; owner supplies the separate exact-SHA main-promotion decision when ready.

#### Approval-stage operation coverage correction

At candidate `40cee9e5093f5e2ff846142c238366e29528aa00`, parent inspection
found the approval-stage caller of `operation_coverage.py`: schema-5 approval
already enforces PRD-to-Wireframe and Visual Approval HiFi joins. The earlier
manual-only conclusion was wrong. Correct the references, all four README
descriptions, L4 disposition and the stale README index status. Preserve the
earlier checkpoint as history. Product task completeness and browser results
still need review; the ordinary PRD parser is not the approval-stage checker.

The first full-suite attempt was stopped after specification, pyflakes and
documentation-size checks passed, because the candidate needs this correction.
Its process tree was inspected, terminated and confirmed stopped; it is not a
full-suite PASS. Repeat the required suite and independent review at the new
committed candidate. Detailed outcomes remain in the external handoff receipt.

Independent Opus 5.5/xhigh review of the prior candidate confirmed this issue
(F1) and found current README/CLAUDE policy-threshold references still missing
the plus sign (F2). Correct those current references while retaining release
history and script compatibility strings. The source review found no security
issue, but withheld PASS until the repaired SHA has complete suite and macOS
evidence. Review result: external bridge run `20260928-001856-8a705840`.

Repair verification: the 180 focused contract/command tests passed again on
the working-tree correction. All nine operation-coverage tests passed, including
a new regression that reads the documented JSON example and checks both matching
designs and rejection of missing controls. No runtime validator behavior changed.

### 2026-09-28 — 0.56.1 acceptance evidence binding

At `main` `37d665f8`, all three exact-main CI jobs passed. A read-only Opus 5.5
review found that `check_delivery_acceptance.py` could report PASS using ignored
or edited register/evidence bytes absent from that HEAD. This violates the
exact-head final-gate rule. The review also noted an older pre-0.38 UI path
issue; it is outside this focused repair and remains unverified here.

Working-tree repair on `codex/release-0.56.1-acceptance-binding`: require the
