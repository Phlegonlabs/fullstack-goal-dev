# EPIC-pre-delivery-self-review: Review each authoring stage before delivery

Status: candidate_verification

## Problem And Baseline

Baseline: main `d7083fb3f43481127fd25252f200e5aa1d37e977`, release 0.56.1.
Post-draft market research and HiFi independent review already exist. Author
self-review is not explicit at each stage exit, and the README diagrams allow
a UI-deferred shortcut into Harness.

## Accepted Scope

The owner requested PRD market research and self-review, UI self-review and
HiFi self-review before Product Delivery Harness execution. Treat UI as
structure/direction review in the current flow, not a restored Wireframe stage.
Update the three owning skills, their relevant flow references, seeded/shared
governance and all four READMEs. Use existing task/evidence records, approvals and
validators; add no schema, product artifact or approval round. Add focused
document-contract regression checks without claiming machine proof of self-review.

Project size: small. Route: direct, one parent writer. UI impact: none.
Gitignore impact: none; verification logs stay outside the checkout and existing
rules cover dependencies and Python caches. This task changes workflow guidance,
not executable validator behavior. The owner's follow-up authorizes commit, push,
PR creation and merge. Release 0.57.0 carries the new stage-exit requirement;
earlier pinned RUNs keep their historical contracts. Resolve the exact branch and
candidate promotion authority under repository governance before those actions.
After a successful skills push, the repository requires the backup-preserving
local installer in the same turn. No new reboot or branch deletion is requested.

## Acceptance And Dependencies

| Contract | Expected outcome | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product Definition | Post-draft research and accepted revisions precede author self-review and existing approval | Inspect skill, market guide and refinement reference |
| UI design | Structure/direction and connected HiFi have separate author checks, evidence and bounded repairs | Inspect skill, review lifecycle and UI pass |
| Responsive review | Preserve the four default Web targets (390/768/1024/1440 CSS px), intermediate-width checks, approved target sets and native size classes | Compare canonical Product responsive contract and modern-design-sources; distinguish 320 px accessibility stress from authored targets |
| Harness entry | Applicable current reviews and existing approvals precede execution; no UI-deferred shortcut | Inspect direct/managed entry and both README diagrams |
| Evidence integrity | No fabricated research, visual PASS, human decision or historical self-review | Cross-reference review limits and source identity rules |
| Documentation | Four language descriptions and diagrams agree | Diff review and repository verification suite |

## Document Impact

The new shared self-review reference is consumed by Product Definition, UI Design
Builder and Delivery Harness. Their existing stage references and README flow
diagrams must agree. The source repository has no consumer PRD or managed RUN.

## Change Log

| Change / request | Reason and scope | Commit / evidence | Verification and remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-28: owner requested pre-delivery self-review | PRD/market, UI direction, HiFi and Harness handoff | First observation at main `d7083fb3`; clean detached worktree at the same SHA | Source contracts inspected; implementation and required checks pending |
| 2026-09-28: responsive and release follow-up | Retain the four Web review targets; publish through commit, push and PR merge | Working-tree contract and 0.57.0 release surfaces | Static checks and five sibling suites passed; Harness/golden-path suite and independent advisory review running |
| 2026-09-28: advisory review and bounded repairs | Clarify backend binding vs initial-delivery prerequisites; restore scoped diagram routes; use present-day catch-up reviews for earlier approvals; reconcile the live index | Working-tree source diff SHA-256 `c09bdfa1880b774405a493902c91a3bff7c9b5a547013d2a883336b346be1bf6`, excluding this Epic and index | Opus 5.5 advisory identified three medium and one low finding; parent checked and repaired them. Fresh exact-SHA independent review remains pending |
| 2026-09-28: verification checkpoint | Preserve installer refusal of untracked skill sources; stage the two new canonical source/test files under commit authority | Installer diagnostic failed before staging and passed after staging; no installer code changed | First Harness run had already failed and was cancelled after 704 seconds; its owned process tree exited. It is not a full-suite PASS. Fixed-candidate full suite and golden path remain required |
| 2026-09-28: owner confirmed release branch | Use `codex/pre-delivery-self-review` for the authorized commit/push/PR workflow | Fresh origin/main fetch remained `d7083fb3f43481127fd25252f200e5aa1d37e977`; branch created from that exact head with scoped changes preserved | Focused contract and static checks passed; prepare a fixed candidate for full verification and fresh security review |

## Results And Remaining Work

Candidate prepared in the attached `self-review-gates` worktree on the
owner-confirmed `codex/pre-delivery-self-review`, based on the freshly observed
origin/main `d7083fb3f43481127fd25252f200e5aa1d37e977`. The primary checkout remains
clean on `main`. Release, final exact-SHA verification and installation are not
claimed by this candidate record; retain their actual results in the release
handoff and PR evidence before claiming completion.

Verification evidence is retained outside the checkout under
`C:/Users/mps19/.codex/work/self-review-20260928/work/`:

- `setup-20260928-114325`: npm ci, Chromium installation and Python test requirements passed.
- `static-20260928-115552`: repaired source passes skill spec, Pyflakes, docs weight and diff whitespace checks; staged whitespace also passed.
- `other-20260928-114339`: Product Definition 240, UI 311 (browser checks required), Design System 120 (4 platform skips), Activation 56 and SEO 21 tests passed before advisory repairs.
- After repairs, the 3 new `test_pre_delivery_self_review.py` checks and 96 Product Definition `test_skill_contract.py` checks passed (parent command transcript).
- `installer-diagnostic-20260928-115007`: the previously failing installer corruption test passed after new source files became tracked.
- `harness-20260928-114339`: failed/cancelled historical run, not release evidence. Golden path did not run.
- Independent advisory: Claude Code Bridge run `20260928-114441-bc47d037`, reported model `claude-opus-5-5`, completed read-only with findings. It is not an exact-SHA security PASS; repairs were checked by the parent only.

Handoff governance audit: shared rules are current against the observed installed
0.56.1 template (Git blob `07e8a2281ddd590caa67f3e902f78c6e31d15e5c`), with the
new additive self-review rule mirrored in source AGENTS and its template for
0.57.0. Keep the documented source-repository omissions and stricter Git Flow.
No consumer PRD, architecture or managed PLAN/RUN exists for this source task.
Existing ignore rules cover node_modules and Python caches; source, lockfile and
regression tests remain tracked. No logs or secrets enter the change.

Next: commit the bounded candidate, run the complete required suite and fresh
exact-SHA security review,
then follow authorized push/PR/promotion, release tag and backup-preserving local
installation. Separate exact-candidate main authorization still applies. Source
is a 0.57.0 candidate; installed skills remain 0.56.1 and loaded identity remains
unknown. No installation, branch deletion or reboot occurred in this task.
