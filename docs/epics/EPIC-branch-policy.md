# EPIC-branch-policy: dual-branch managed release policy

Status: in_progress

## Problem And Baseline

The 0.58 flow required every initial delivery and enhancement to start from remote `main` and refused `development` everywhere. The approved workflow needs ordinary releases to build from a frozen `development` base and hotfixes from `main`, while keeping both protected branches permanent and preserving local-only RUNs.

Baseline: repository checkout at detached `bdae1d82`, Harness 0.58.0, with no branch-policy field or dual-branch architecture marker.

## Accepted Scope

The approved MOD-C task authorizes source branch-policy implementation, affected Product Definition release contracts, current references/templates, four README descriptive sections, and this Epic. It authorizes local atomic commits and parent integration; pushes, installation, deletion, protected-branch mutation, frontend UI portions, root AGENTS, version bump, and final release suite are out of scope.

The accepted interface is:

- `PLAN.branch_policy` contains exactly protocol `dual-branch/1`, kind `ordinary|hotfix`, canonical `refs/remotes/<remote>/development` or `/main`, and the frozen full base SHA.
- 0.59+ current joins require the policy, the active architecture marker, and local base ancestry. Pre-0.59 pins keep old semantics; malformed pins grant nothing.
- Wave re-anchoring advances `integration` state only. The PLAN base stays frozen.
- Exact-A corrections retain their receipt-bound continuation exception but still carry policy/marker and strong archive provenance.
- Archive receipt/anchor/publication formats, `expected_main`, and `main_ref` remain unchanged.
- `main`, ordinary `development`, and the observed default branch are refused for cleanup, local and remote spellings included.

## Acceptance And Dependencies

| Requirement / TEST ID | Expected outcome | Verification / environment | Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HARNESS-BRANCH-001 | Valid and malformed policy shapes, base refs, and old/malformed pins are distinguished | `test_branch_policy.py` | none |
| HARNESS-BRANCH-002 | Current joins use the canonical active parser and reject ambiguous/unknown markers | `test_validate_harness_plan.py`, `test_product_package_checker.py` | none |
| HARNESS-BRANCH-003 | Current RUN/archive validation fails without the policy even before a repo-root authority join | `test_harness_manifest.py` and archive/publisher validators | parent 0.59 version bump |
| HARNESS-BRANCH-004 | Local, remote, and observed-default protected targets cannot pass delete authorization | `test_lifecycle_cleanup_targets.py` | none |
| HARNESS-BRANCH-005 | New RUN/template and current docs describe the same flow | `test_new_run.py`, `test_skill_contract.py` | parent integration |
| HARNESS-JOIN-001 | `design-system/4` uses the canonical compiler checker for registry and pair validation | `test_contract_source_binding.py` | frontend digest repair integration |
| HARNESS-JOIN-002 | A fresh enhancement label cannot retain `ui-design/2`; a frozen validated maintenance record can | `test_contract_source_binding.py` | frontend digest repair integration |
| HARNESS-GOLDEN-001 | The enabled golden flow consumes genuine UI3/DS4 evidence, a frozen dual-branch base, and current approval hashes | `test_golden_path.py` with `HARNESS_GOLDEN_PATH=1` | frontend digest repair integration |
| HARNESS-GOLDEN-002 | The lifecycle golden flow uses the same current package and verifies DS4 pair staleness recovery | `test_lifecycle_golden_path.py` | frontend digest repair integration |
| HARNESS-PACKET-001 | Design authoring packet ordering follows the current wording without weakening either pinned skill or binding checks | `test_cross_skill_pipeline.py::test_design_authoring_worker_packet_requires_both_pinned_skills` | none |
| HARNESS-RENDER-001 | Tasks-view generation uses current dual-branch packaging while retaining renderer safety behaviors | `test_render_tasks_view.py` | none |

## Document Impact

| Changed source / requirement | Affected live artifact | Required recheck |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dual-branch release policy | Harness PLAN/RUN contracts and templates | focused/final Harness suites |
| Architecture marker and protocol | Product Definition output, interview, agent graph, playbook | Product parser and contract tests |
| Protected landing/promotion flow | Promotion, deployment, execution-state, worktree, operating rules, READMEs | final docs/contract suite |

## Results And Remaining Work

Earlier branch-policy and MOD-JOIN commits are integrated. The current golden repair is contained in the atomic commit that adds the HARNESS-GOLDEN rows.

The bounded archive suite passed 48 tests. A 300-second bounded run of the publisher suite timed out and was stopped; it needs the parent's longer final-suite budget. Remaining: parent integration, frontend overlap reconciliation, independent exact-head review, 0.59 final suite, release documentation/version-history ownership, and any final security review. No push, install, branch deletion, worktree removal, or protected-branch mutation was performed. Root AGENTS remains owner-owned for the parent's final main-only migration; this checkout observed VERSION 0.59.0 and did not edit it.

- 2026-10-03 consolidation repair, baseline `108ec8014b808ff40432ed0adf49dcefe76104ce` on `codex/harness-flow-modernization`: independent correctness review found that plan-only validation treated absent RUN as an old pin. Validate an explicit PLAN branch policy and architecture marker together; retain actual historical RUN rules and defer candidate ancestry until RUN exists. Update the golden-path expectation, branch-policy matrix, promotion reference and all four README descriptions. UI impact none. The new regression failed before the fix; working-tree checks then passed branch policy 9/9 and the full golden path 1/1, including missing marker/policy, invalid base, duplicate/unknown marker and old-pin rejection. Whitespace passed. Logs and the scoped diff/commit receipt are under `C:/Users/mps19/AppData/Local/Temp/pdh-worktree-merge-20261003-eb6k85jg`. Fresh final-SHA CI and follow-up review remain pending; this check grants no execution or protected landing.
