# Design Review Lifecycle

Use the existing Epic, direct-task record or PLAN/RUN as the work record. These rules do not create a second specification or approval database.

| Work | Baseline and required design |
| --- | --- |
| Initial design | Approved product/stack, PRD completeness preflight, direction choice and full HiFi review |
| Enhancement | Current accepted product; added/changed pages and necessary connecting flows; retained direction when unchanged |
| Maintenance | Current product, effective requirements and accepted changes; direct product fixes and verification |
| Explicit full redesign | Complete `ui-design/3` sequence for the named scope |

The approved HiFi is this round's implementation baseline. After delivery, accepted product changes become the maintenance baseline. Do not rewrite historic HiFi, tokens or approvals merely to match routine work. A new product or technology decision returns to the corresponding owner flow.

For a managed Harness maintenance route, freeze the matching `docs/epics/EPIC-*.md` as a PLAN source with `kind: task record` and its full Git `source_revision`. The Epic must carry exact top-level `Design workflow: maintenance`, `UI impact: none` or `UI impact: style`, `Plan ID: <exact plan_id>`, `Plan objective: <exact objective>`, `Requirement refs: REQ-...[, ...]`, and `UI scope: UI-...[, ...]`. Requirement refs match current UI mission traces, and each trace includes this task-record source ID; UI scope matches affected PLAN surfaces. Keep retained UI design, wireframe, HiFi and design-system-pair bytes stable. The current Product Definition and PLAN route/state/target joins still apply. `structure` or `both` follows normal affected design gates; a loose task note or unrelated Epic cannot waive them.

## One Author And Consolidated Approval

Before direction/HiFi authoring or repair, run `python "<delivery-harness-skill-root>/scripts/check_skill_bindings.py" --agents-md <target-AGENTS.md> --stage ui-design` with installed-command resolution. Authoring requires the host's actual `frontend_worker`; the parent cannot author it directly. The resolved writer loads the full owner-pinned `frontend-design` skill in its own context. Parent reading, a snapshot, a role name or prior-stage invocation is no substitute; do not backfill evidence or replace the binding. Missing or conflicting dependencies block only that authoring stage and preserve earlier approvals and closed history. This requirement grants no spawn action. Preserve one design author. UI research may use multiple readonly researchers/explorers, but graders do not become researchers and the grader count cap does not limit them. Assemblers, Impeccable, and graders validate and do not make product-design decisions. Record source digest, output identity and applied choices in Frontend Design Usage; the record proves traceability, not quality.

For UI research, inventory substantive independent questions and call `createReadonlyAssignments(request)` from `../../product-definition-builder/scripts/readonly_assignments.cjs` with `schema_version: readonly-assignments/1`, phase `ui_research` (or `code_exploration` for code), the observed host researcher/explorer identity, `binding_required: true`, authorized readonly/launch capabilities and frozen PRD/candidate/source hashes. Follow `../../product-definition-builder/references/agent-work-graph.md#current-packet-api` for the exact request and result fields. Launch one instance per question in dependency-ready waves sized by observed capacity, then call `joinReadonlyResults(plan, results, parentLaunchRecords)` using separately retained parent launch observations. Store the inventory, packets, launch evidence and joined findings in the existing Epic/task record; add no database or parallel artifact system. Missing required authorization, capability or results blocks the dependent work. A reviewer lacking required browser capability remains blocked; researcher findings or the parent's browser session cannot substitute for that review.

Combine missing design, image and motion preferences. Reuse supplied answers. Run:

Product/stack and PRD preflight with `--ui-contract ui-design/3` → unresolved preferences → three rendered direction studies, each self-checked by the same author → owner select/mix/modify → complete HiFi at every approved and intermediate width, cheap completeness preflight and HiFi author self-review → technical checks, Impeccable and grading → one human Visual Approval → design-system package compile/update/reuse → Harness handoff check → implementation. A retained `ui-design/2` package keeps its original sequence and conditional compiler.

Use `../../delivery-harness/references/pre-delivery-self-review.md` for the two checks by the same producing agent and their evidence. PRD self-review belongs to Product Definition after market reconciliation and before its approval. In the existing Epic/task record, record the producing agent identity, equal self-check agent identity, final candidate hash, actual checks, findings and repairs, and link the current candidate and review evidence. Complete repair and recheck before owner choice or approval; stale hashes do not count. An unresolved required finding blocks the next dependent stage; a structural checker PASS or the producing agent's own score does not replace independent review or human approval.

A `ui-design/2` package has no wireframe, W1–W5, Copy Freeze or human Wireframe Approval stage. It reads the PRD's complete sourced wording and contract directly. The final HiFi review includes wording, structure, product menus, tabs, other interactions, visuals and all product tokens. Formal design-system compilation runs only when the Need Gate requires it.

## Incremental Scope And Derived Status

Before an enhancement, record baseline revision and added/changed/preserved paths in the existing task record. Include all consumers of changed shared components and styles. Use this small section in that record:

Design workflow: enhancement

### UI Change Scope

| Disposition | Path | Reason / consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| changed | docs/design/ui-references/round/account.html | Accepted account change and return flow |
| preserved | docs/design/ui-references/round/home.html | No product change |
| shared | src/components/navigation.tsx | Account and home regression consumers |

Run from the repository root:

    python "<ui-design-builder-skill-root>/scripts/design_workflow.py" --repo-root . --task-record docs/epics/EPIC-current.md --baseline <observed-commit>

The read-only summary derives HEAD, current changes, record identity, task-file presence, unresolved checkboxes and next work. It checks canonical `docs/goal/PLAN.md` and `docs/goal/RUN.md` plus legacy paths; its `activeTaskFiles` field records paths present on disk only and does not establish an active RUN or live process. A maintenance record is valid only with UI impact `none` or `style`; missing or invalid impact and `structure` or `both` are findings and conservatively set `designRequired`. Structural impacts follow affected design gates. Valid maintenance does not require full design regeneration. Preserved page changes are findings. Inspect product DOM/style and rendered before/after evidence too: file hashes cannot distinguish an intentional shell migration from an unintended product redesign. A new hash never proves semantic equivalence.

At start, significant changes and handoff, reconcile checkout, candidate, uncommitted work, other active tasks and prior results. PLAN revisions preserve completed work and apply at explicit task boundaries. Small work stays direct; durable multi-writer coordination uses the existing managed flow. Reuse timing records for generation, validation, waiting and repair costs.

## Validation Cost And Evidence

The skills suite tests the full common shell. Each product package still verifies every page's integration, isolation, platform/size/state, menu/tab destinations, error recovery, required operations and final full product matrix. Avoid all-pairs shell navigation repetition when the current reviewer contract uses per-page integration cases. Compute changed pages and shared consumers before editing, run focused checks after repair, then retain required final full validation. Never reuse expired browser results. App implementation still requires native proof.

New evidence uses ui-output/3 and ui-evidence/3; see review-evidence.md. Separate machine observations, qualitative findings and human decisions. Repair by root cause under the existing attempt limits; do not reset counters by changing authors or candidates.

## Versions And Migration

Record source, installed and actually loaded skill identities separately; unknown loaded identity remains unknown. Pin each round. Before upgrading, classify the effect: reviewer shell, schema/format, validation rule, or product design. Evaluate affected evidence and retain valid product decisions.

wireframes/2–5 and `ui-design` packages without `UI contract: ui-design/2` remain readable under their original meanings. A legacy approved artifact still uses its historical Copy Freeze, Wireframe Approval or Validation, W1–W5 and compiler inputs. Do not relabel it or fabricate a new human decision. The legacy heading does not keep old HiFi evidence rules. A legacy Visual Approval decided on or after 2026-09-27 (the 0.55.0 release), or with any HiFi Review or motion-effect receipt executed at or after 2026-09-27T00:00:00Z, always needs ui-evidence/3, reviewer shell version 3 and `direction`/`hifi` Frontend Design Usage rows, and its Decided on must not predate that evidence; committing or backdating it does not make it historical. An earlier approval keeps its ui-evidence/2 HiFi receipts only while its Approved target equals the one committed at HEAD; a new or changed target needs current evidence. Publication, the compiler preflight and Harness 0.55.1+ UI and pair joins enforce the dated rule; only publication also compares the target with HEAD. New initial and full-redesign packages use `ui-design/3`; `ui-design/2` packages keep their original meaning, including `not_required` gates. Existing products migrate gradually under authorized scope. Migrate through a fresh owner-selected direction and complete HiFi, rerun affected product checks, and preserve historical bytes/receipts. A shell-only update never authorizes product redesign.

Publication, installation, commits, branches/worktrees, provider calls and cleanup retain their own exact authorization boundaries.

## Required Product Operations

Before designing, read necessary Home, back, cancel, recovery, navigation and tab actions from each PRD task. The PRD UI Surface Contract's invariant operations anchor keeps their meaning product-owned. This explicit list prevents directions and HiFi from both omitting the same operation.

Example:

- `operations`: [{"id":"OP-account-home","trigger":"Home","control":"home","sourceState":"ready","destination":{"surface":"UI-001","state":"ready"},"presentation":"page"}]

Each operation uses exactly id, trigger, control (HiFi product control ID), sourceState, destination (surface/state) and presentation (page, overlay, feedback, state or tab). IDs are unique. An informational surface with no action records none — followed by a concrete reason. Include open/close, selection, recovery and state changes when the PRD requires them. Compare actual browser destinations and visible content; updating an active class alone is insufficient.

The PRD-side checker joins these operations to the UI Surface Contract, and the HiFi completeness preflight joins them to manifest interactions before formal review. The browser checker rejects missing required controls, invented states/destinations and HiFi actions without a product operation. For legacy schema-5 approval gates, `check_ui_design_contract.py` uses `operation_coverage.py` to join each operations anchor to Wireframe flows and, for Visual Approval, to HiFi interactions. Neither check can infer an omitted requirement from prose: the Product Definition review must reconcile this list with user tasks, including Home/back/cancel. Retain browser evidence of destinations and visible results in the existing review evidence. A structural check without the required approval flags does not establish operation coverage.
