# Source Maintenance

These rules own skill-source reading, Git, release verification, installation, and review. They authorize only actions explicitly granted by the owner or a matching RUN ledger.

## Required Reading

- Before editing `skills/` or any documented flow, read the canonical SKILL.md and the references the change touches; the four READMEs are the documentation of record.
- Before running a Product Delivery Harness flow in a target repository, that repository's seeded `AGENTS.md` Required Reading rules govern the session — they are mandatory, not advisory.
- Work that skipped this reading is a blocking review finding.

## Mission Task Split

- When decomposing a PRD into full-delivery missions, split each mission into more, finer tasks: one task per small, independently verifiable step, so each step is done and checked carefully.
- Each task keeps its own atomic commit. Finer tasks stay sequential checkpoints inside their mission. A section may contain several independent frontend, backend or integration missions after shared interfaces are frozen; each writer uses an isolated checkout and a nonconflicting scope.

## Git Flow

- Before every authorized commit, read [Atomic Commit Convention](../commit-convention.md). Direct tasks use `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`; managed task and mission trailers apply only inside managed runs.
- This skills source repository is maintained for the owner's own use. Protect `main` permanently. Use temporary work branches and reviewed PRs directly to `main`; no `development` branch or development integration is required. The consumer branch-promotion contract governs consuming repositories, not this source-maintenance route. Preserve exact-candidate verification, atomic history and separate publication authority.
- Before any action represented in the RUN authorization ledger, verify its exact authorization. When a RUN ledger exists, the matching action must be true for the exact target; direct work without RUN still requires an explicit user instruction for the covered mutation.
- With matching `create_local_branches` authorization, create the exact non-default work branch named by governance or the user from observed released `main`. Preserve the original base. If the branch name is unresolved, ask; never add a fixed prefix. Never recreate `development` for source maintenance.
- With matching `create_local_commits` authorization, commit only the verified task scope. Commit atomically: one commit per minimal logical change (matching the minimal task split), never bundling unrelated changes.
- Worker branches and worktrees stay local. With matching `integrate_locally` authorization, the parent integrates verified worker commits into that one run branch.
- Harness 0.38+ RUNs close `local_only` at candidate C. Their `push` authorization remains false, `pushed_head_sha` remains null, and PLAN contains no push lifecycle node. Explicitly pinned pre-0.38 RUNs retain their historical run-branch push path only for recovery.
- After RUN close, archive on the same work branch with exact main evidence and an immutable checkout-external anchor, create archive-only direct child A, and verify archived PLAN/RUN, receipt, anchor, relocation and required candidate checks. The frozen PLAN also preserves the original development/hotfix base. Publishing A to its work branch retains the separate trusted-host request/attempt/receipt; it grants no protected-branch landing. Never force-push.
- Land a reviewed fixed candidate directly into `main` only under separate exact target/SHA authorization and the required PR mechanism. Preserve atomic task history. If the provider creates a new main SHA, prove candidate tree equality and run fresh required exact-main verification before tagging or completing the release. This source route creates no product deployment or consumer hotfix forward-integration obligation.
- Branch deletion and worktree removal are separate actions. Do not infer approval for them from implementation or from a successful push.

## Update Local Skills

- After a verified formal release, compare its seven-skill bundle digest with the observed installed digest. When different, complete one local update at a quiescent boundary in the release handoff; a feature or development push does not replace the installed release. An explicitly requested development installation is a separate channel and never becomes the official release by implication. Quiesce only relevant active skill-using sessions, then run `install.sh` or `install.ps1` against `~/.agents/skills/`. It installs `delivery-harness`, `product-definition-builder`, `ui-design-builder`, `design-system-compiler`, `code-security-review`, `product-activation`, and `seo-growth-review`; retires `full-harness`, `prd-builder`, and `product-design-builder`; and writes prior copies under `~/.agents/skill-backups/product-delivery-harness/`. Never replace the installer with manual move/copy commands; never overwrite or delete prior copies or backups. A failed install rolls itself back. If post-install verification fails, rerun the installer from the previous release tag so it backs up the bad copy first. Restart the relevant host only after successful verification and when needed to load changed skills. If installation cannot finish, report it pending; do not claim the release handoff fully complete.
- Per-runtime copies (Codex plugin, Claude plugin, Pi extension) stay retired. Do not install, update, or reinstall them.

## Required Verification

Edit the canonical skill sources in `skills/`. For each atomic task, run focused checks for its changed behavior and negative cases; unknown impact requires the full applicable suite. Source maintenance does not create a consumer Product Definition, UI approval, Activation pass or managed archive merely to edit a skill. Before a formal release, run the complete required matrix below on the fixed candidate from the repository root. Preserve all suites; this separates the development loop from release verification.

For required UI browser checks, prepare dependencies with `npm ci` and `npx playwright install chromium` when missing or changed, then set `PDH_REQUIRE_BROWSER_TESTS=1` and `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` to this checkout's `node_modules/playwright`. Reuse only an observed installation matching the current lockfile and Playwright browser revision; do not reinstall it for every task. Linux CI installs Chromium with `--with-deps`. Missing prerequisites must fail required browser verification. Python test dependencies follow the current requirements file.

```

CI retains the same required coverage with exact-candidate jobs and a required aggregate. A successful deterministic suite may be cited from that same exact SHA and unchanged configuration, dependencies and toolchain; retain its origin, do not relabel it as a fresh execution. New SHA or relevant input changes require new evidence. Security freshness, browser/live state and migration checks retain their own contracts. Never cache PASS or waive a missing platform result.

Every flow that promotes to `main` bumps the release version in the same change: `package.json`, `skills/delivery-harness/VERSION`, the README badges and version-history entries in all four languages, and the RUNBOOK `required_harness_version` default. `test_skill_contract.py` reads `VERSION` and fails when any of these surfaces differ from it. A breaking skill-bundle change bumps the minor version. After the release promotion reaches `main`, tag that commit with the matching `v<version>` tag — the READMEs' Releasing section is the full checklist.

Any change that adds or alters a skill, rule, or documented flow also updates the READMEs' descriptive sections in the same change, in all four languages — the README is documentation-of-record, not a release-time artifact.

## Review Guidelines

Treat these as blocking findings:

- Any path that bypasses explicit action authorization for one of the 12 ledger keys: `invoke_external_runtime`, `spawn_subagents`, `create_user_owned_tasks`, `create_local_worktrees`, `create_app_managed_worktrees`, `create_local_branches`, `create_local_commits`, `integrate_locally`, `push`, `archive_worker_tasks`, `remove_worktrees`, or `delete_branches`.
- Any Harness 0.38+ RUN with `integration_push`, non-null `pushed_head_sha`, enabled push grant, or a push lifecycle node; any legacy RUN push that reaches `main` or `development`; or any run whose integration branch resolves to either name.
- Any archive-candidate publication that lacks the receipt-bound immutable external anchor and separately authorized external request/attempt/receipt, does not prove exact C-to-A relocation, uses force, accepts remote drift, or fails to read back exact A. Neither it nor a legacy RUN grant authorizes development or main landing.
- Any source main promotion lacking separate exact branch/SHA authorization, required candidate verification or the repository PR mechanism is blocking. Never force-push, lose task ancestry or delete main. A server-created main SHA requires verified tree equality and fresh complete exact-main verification before tagging or release completion. Consumer promotions retain [branch-promotion-contract](../branch-promotion-contract.md).
- Any gate PASS that is not bound to the exact integration head SHA.
- Any worker that edits parent-owned PLAN/RUN state, escapes its write scope, or independently pushes.
- Any behavior change without focused tests, or any test/workflow command that does not run from the repository root.

Do not report formatting preferences as blockers. Focus on correctness, authorization boundaries, stale-state safety, data preservation, and missing verification.
