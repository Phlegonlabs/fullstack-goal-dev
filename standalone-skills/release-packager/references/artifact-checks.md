# Artifact Checks And Delivery

## Inspect Actual Payloads

Retain the native build/pack commands, tool versions, exit codes and final artifact inventory. Inspect archives without executing their contents first. Extract only into a new isolated destination with traversal/link protections appropriate to the format; do not unpack over an existing checkout or install directory.

Verify each declared entry point, runtime asset, license and applicable README/metadata file inside the artifact. Check names/version against the component's authoritative source, accounting for native normalization such as Python distribution names. A publishable child and a private monorepo root have different identities. Match lockfile/dependency/runtime constraints to the actual build.

Keep secrets and unrelated data out of the payload. Inspect names/metadata first; a suspected credential file is a packaging failure, not permission to read or reproduce its value. Check the runtime's actual inclusion rules: a file allowlist or ignore file alone does not prove the archive contents.

## Exercise The Consumer Path

Use the actual tarball, wheel, source distribution, extracted binary, image or app package in an authorized disposable environment. Test the README's primary install/import/CLI/startup path with a finite deadline. Avoid source-directory imports, workspace links or previously installed versions that can hide missing files. Record when hooks/network access/dependencies were excluded or unavailable.

Check one useful behavior beyond an artifact listing or version label. For a library this may be a minimal API call; for a CLI a tiny input fixture; for an app/container the existing startup/health path. Check all selected mandatory targets on matching runners. An unavailable platform or signing tool cannot receive a functional/signature PASS from another host.

When a check fails, keep the artifact, command and bounded failure log, state the affected component/target, and fix only the accepted packaging scope. A missing output asset, runtime dependency, wrong entry point or version is a real gap. Finish independent targets and preserve unresolved ones. Do not publish a diagnostic build as a successful release.

## Reconcile Documentation And Publication

Confirm README examples, compatibility, download links and release notes against each final artifact and channel. Use the source project's language and existing version/changelog conventions. Independently versioned desktop/CLI/SDK packages need separate rows; one channel's version cannot stand in for all channels.

Repository-relative images/links may not work in a registry or extracted package. Check the distributed README and intended renderer, or reuse the project's derived registry copy. A local build or publication dry-run does not prove that a public download URL exists. npm package-page README updates follow package publication; a repository edit alone cannot update it. Source: [npm README behavior](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-package-readme-files).

If publication is authorized, use the selected native release path and verify the remote name/version and immutable artifact identity afterward. Rebuilding between verification and upload changes the artifact: verify the uploaded bytes or bind them to the checked package. Preserve previous releases and registry immutability. GitHub's automatic source archives do not prove that an installable binary/package was produced; see [GitHub releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases).

## Delivery Record

Use the existing release/task record. A compact per-artifact table is enough:

| Component / version | Source identity | Runtime / platform | Artifact location | SHA-256 or image identity | Verification | Publication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Populate rows from actual evidence, including every requested component/target. For files, hash the final bytes after signing, stapling or repacking. For containers, distinguish local image ID, exported-file SHA-256 and remote manifest/per-platform digest. List source SHA plus scoped uncommitted input evidence when applicable. Record precise states such as built, install-tested, signature-verified, unverified target and published/read-back; do not combine them into a vague readiness claim.

Link the actual package files, checksums, command results and required visual evidence. Name remaining capabilities, signing material or authority needed. Stop temporary task-owned processes by verified identity and retain task artifacts/logs; shared services are not task-owned cleanup targets.
